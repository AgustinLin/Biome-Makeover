### Code
We do accept contributions for bug fixes, but will likely reject any feature contribution.  
If you wish to contribute, it's best to contact us on Discord first so you don't waste your time.

### Translations
We welcome and appreciate all translations. If you would like to contribute translations but do not know Git, you can send your translations to us through Discord.

## Licence 
See our full licence file for details.  
It's designed so you can't just rip our textures or features fully.  
Take our code and learn from it, but make something unique.   
If the project is abandoned (terms listed in the licence file) this repo will default to a MIT licence.
